<?php
/**
 * Takes one guestbook entry down, from the link in its notification email.
 *
 * The only page in the project that renders HTML rather than JSON. It is not
 * part of the app — it is reached from an email, on a phone, by one person, and
 * loading the whole React bundle to draw two sentences and a button would be
 * absurd.
 *
 *   GET  ?id=&sig=  -> shows the entry and a confirm button
 *   POST ?id=&sig=  -> deletes it
 *
 * **The deletion is on the POST, and that is the point of the page existing.**
 * A link in an email gets fetched by things that are not the recipient — mail
 * clients prefetch, scanners follow every URL in a message to see where it goes,
 * and some corporate filters do it twice. If the GET deleted, an entry could be
 * gone before Jamie had read the mail, with nothing to say what happened. A GET
 * that only ever shows a page is safe to prefetch as many times as anyone likes.
 *
 * There is no login. The signature in the link is an HMAC of the entry id under
 * the site secret, so it authorises exactly one action on exactly one entry and
 * cannot be edited into a link that removes a different one.
