 * Keeping the response body clean
 *
 * PHP prints warnings into the output by default, and these endpoints answer
 * with JSON — so one warning ahead of the body makes the whole response
 * unparseable. That is not hypothetical: mail() warns whenever the local mailer
 * exits non-zero, and it happened here. The guestbook entry was stored, the
 * notification was attempted, the handler returned a perfectly good
 * {"ok":true} — and the page said "Something went wrong", because json() threw
 * on the "<br /><b>Warning</b>" in front of it.
 *
 * Worse, it was invisible to the test suites, which checked status codes. The
 * status was 200 the whole time.
 *
 * Two layers, because the failure is silent and expensive:
 *
 *  1. display_errors off. Errors still reach error_reporting and the host's
 *     error log, which is where a warning belongs on an endpoint nobody reads
 *     by eye. This is the fix.
 *  2. An output buffer that respond() throws away. Anything that still manages
 *     to print — a stray echo, a notice raised before this file is reached, a
 *     host that overrides display_errors — cannot get in front of the JSON.
 *
 * tests/guestbook.sh and tests/contact.sh both now parse the body rather than
 * trusting the status line, so a regression here fails a test.
