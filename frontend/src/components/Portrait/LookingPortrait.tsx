 * Only the default gets this. The FF7 character faces come out of a single
 * spritesheet with one frame each, so there is nothing to swap to, and the
 * easter egg is a static likeness anyway.
 *
 * Blinking is not built in: the caller owns it, so the landing page can blink
 * him on a hit and hold his eyes shut while he is dead, rather than fighting a
 * timer inside here. A caller that only wants the idle rhythm passes useBlink
 * straight through.
 *
 * It does not follow only the mouse. Anything that knows where attention has
 * gone can aim it through lookAt -- the landing page's keyboard cursor does,
 * and so does a touch.
