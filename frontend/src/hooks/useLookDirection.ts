 *   - one column per entry in LOOK_DIRECTIONS, in that order;
 *   - the top row eyes open, the bottom row the same poses with eyes shut.
 *
 * A sheet with a column missing, an extra one, or the poses reordered will
 * still render -- it will simply point every glance the wrong way, which is
 * easy to mistake for a bug in the tracking. Change this and the artwork
 * together.
 *
 * **The sheet in the repo does not fully meet this.** Its columns are not on an
 * even pitch -- the nine faces sit in three groups of three with uneven gutters,
 * measuring 51 to 57px against the 53.4 an even ninth implies -- so the offset
 * cuts slightly into the face next door, worst on the middle three. Each cell
 * also carries a blank first row, which the browser blends into the pose above
 * it as it upscales. Both are fixed by exporting the sheet on an even grid with
 * a 1px margin around every cell; neither is fixable in the code without moving
 * the artwork, which was tried and reverted.
