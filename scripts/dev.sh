# Two servers. Vite serves the app on 5173 as it always did, and PHP serves the
# handlers on 8123; vite.config.ts proxies /contact.php, /guestbook.php and
# /guestbook-moderate.php across to it. So the app fetches same-origin URLs, the
# handlers run for real, and hot reload still works — there is no build step in
# the loop.
#
# **This is what was missing before.** `vite` alone does not run PHP, so
# /contact.php fell through the SPA rewrite and came back as index.html: the
# form posted to the app and got a web page in reply. The only way to exercise a
# handler was to build, stage a config and a router into dist/, and serve that —
# a full rebuild for every change to a form.
#
# Mail is captured, never sent, and tailed into this terminal. That is how you
# get at a guestbook delete link: it exists in the notification and nowhere else.
